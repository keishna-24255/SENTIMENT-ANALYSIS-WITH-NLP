#DESCRIPTION ABOUT MY PROJECT

This project focuses on building a Sentiment Analysis System using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. The aim of this project is to demonstrate how machine learning and NLP can be applied to analyze opinions, emotions, and attitudes expressed in textual data such as tweets, reviews, comments, and feedback. Sentiment analysis is widely used in industries like marketing, customer experience, e-commerce, and social media monitoring.

In this project, we preprocess raw text, extract meaningful features, train a machine learning model, and evaluate its accuracy using standard datasets. The final output is a system that can automatically predict the sentiment of any given text input.

⭐ Project Workflow
1. Data Collection

The dataset used typically contains text samples along with labeled sentiments (positive, negative, neutral). Public datasets like IMDB Movie Reviews, Twitter Sentiment Dataset, or custom datasets can be used. These datasets provide a strong foundation for training the model to understand emotional cues in text.

2. Data Preprocessing

Raw text cannot be directly used for machine learning, so several cleaning steps were performed:

Converting all text to lowercase

Removing unwanted characters, punctuation, and special symbols

Removing stopwords (like the, is, are etc.)

Tokenization – converting sentences into individual words

Lemmatization/Stemming – reducing words like running → run

Preprocessing ensures the model receives clean and meaningful data, improving accuracy and reducing noise.

3. Feature Extraction

Since machine learning models cannot understand words directly, the text was converted into numerical features using:

Bag of Words (BoW)

TF-IDF Vectorization

These methods convert text into vectors based on word frequency and importance. TF-IDF was chosen because it gives more meaningful weight to important words.

4. Model Training

For this project, models such as:

Logistic Regression

Naive Bayes

Support Vector Machine (SVM)
were considered for training.

Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes typically performs very well in sentiment analysis tasks. The model learns patterns, tone, positivity, negativity, and emotional markers in the text.

5. Model Evaluation

To measure the model's performance, the dataset was split into training and testing sets. Evaluation metrics include:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

Confusion Matrix

These metrics help us understand how well the system predicts different sentiments.
